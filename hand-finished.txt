// Perform lateral raises as normal, except going until your hands are up overhead. As you break parallel, you will use more upper traps to move the weight. Feel free to squeeze your upper traps at the top. If you feel shoulder pain when going all the way up, try pointing your thumb up or simply stop at parallel and do normal lateral raises.

// Hold a dumbbell and perform a jumping motion without actually leaving the floor, using a slight knee bend, but mostly relying on your calves/ankles to drive the "jump". I believe I built a lot of calf mass by doing jump rope; these are meant to provide a similar stimulus, but with more tension.
